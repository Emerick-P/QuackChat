    Partially updates the duck for the authenticated user.
    Editable fields are defined in EDITABLE_FIELDS (imported from app.services.ducks).

    Steps:
    1. Extracts only the fields sent and allowed via extract_patch (EDITABLE_FIELDS).
    2. Validates the color if present in the patch (allowed palette).
    3. Applies the patch to the duck with apply_duck_patch (returns final state and changes).

        request (Request): FastAPI request object containing the request context.
